# Recommendation System

## Introduction

This repository contains code for building a recommendation system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with the Surprise library in Python. The recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user ratings.


**Dataset**
The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation system is sourced from MovieLens. It consists of user ratings for various movies.
Model Training: The recommendation system utilizes the SVD algorithm, a matrix factorization technique, to learn latent factors representing users and items (movies). These latent factors capture underlying patterns in the user-item interaction matrix, enabling the system to make accurate predictions for unseen user-item pairs.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the recommendation system is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics help assess the predictive accuracy of the model and ensure that it generalizes well to unseen data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Grid search is employed to optimize the hyperparameters of the SVD algorithm. Parameters such as the number of latent factors and the regularization term are tuned to improve the model's performance.
Model Serialization: Once the optimal model is trained and evaluated, it is serialized using the pickle library. This allows the model to be saved to disk and reloaded later for making predictions or further analysis.
Usage: The recommendation system can be easily integrated into applications or services that require personalized recommendations for users. By providing movie ratings, users can receive tailored movie suggestions based on their preferences and behavior.

In conclusion, this recommendation system leverages SVD, a powerful matrix factorization technique, to provide personalized movie recommendations. By combining user ratings with item features, the system can accurately predict user preferences and suggest relevant movies. The model is trained, evaluated, and serialized for easy deployment and integration into various applications.
